# My_Virtual_Solar_Farm
This repo is my attempt to create a virtual solar farm from real solar irradiance and mock data.

The site I chose to emulate is the 30MW Santhiou solar plant in Meckhe Senegal.

 Santhiou allows for the production of 30 MWp, equivalent to the annual consumption of over 250,000 households or 2 million people.

Construction cost: 27 billion CFA francs (approximately 41 million euros)
Erected on an area of 64 hectares, the Santhiou Mékhé solar power plant is considered the largest in West Africa.
It comprises 92,160 solar panels, 36 inverters, and 3 transformers connected to the station located 9 kilometers from the site.
It required one year of work (2016-2017), 20,000 working hours, and 350 workers, including 150 from the surrounding villages of Santhiou Mékhé.
For the first year, production is estimated at 50 GW/h.

For this project, I extracted the solar irradiance data of the solar plant's location (15.13, -16.67) in 2019 and simulated the yearly functioning of 980 Q Cells G8+ panels (340W) distributed between 70 Fox F5000 Single Phase Inverters (5kw) for a total theoretical capacity of 333Kw.
